# Data Structures in Python üêç

Welcome to the **Data Structures in Python** repository! This project contains implementations of various fundamental data structures using Python. The goal is to provide clear, concise, and educational examples for learning and reference purposes.

## üéØ About This Project

This repository serves as a personal project to implement and understand core data structures from scratch in Python. Each data structure is implemented with a focus on readability and correctness. Documentation for each structure will include explanations of its operations and their time/space complexity (Big O notation).

## ‚ú® Data Structures Covered (Planned)

The following data structures are planned for implementation:

* **Arrays:** (While Python lists are dynamic arrays, specific array concepts or fixed-size implementations might be explored).
* **Linked Lists:**
    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
* **Sparse Matrix:** Efficient representation for matrices with mostly zero elements.
* **Stack:** Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure.
* **Queue:** First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure.
* **Trees:**
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree (BST)
    * AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)
    * Heap (Min-Heap/Max-Heap)
    * Trie (Prefix Tree)
* **Hashtable:** Key-value store using hashing (Collision handling strategies will be explored).
